//public: this allows classes and objects outside of your project to access your class. 
//class: the blueprint for an object/ Notice:Not capitalized
//RUnner: the name of the class. Names of classes are ALWAYS capitalized/
//{}the curly braces indicate the beginning and ending of the code for the class
// static: formal definition: a member of class that is not associated with an instance of a class. 
// informal def: code that can be run without creating an object  // make it independent
// void: does not return anything. Code methods can be writtent hat return a number or a String or many other things.
// code methods that do not return anything are called void methods
//main: key word indicating "start here" to the computer
//() parameters are inside these parentheses. A parameter is data that the method needs to run
//String [] This is a box called an array with three Strings in it. This set of Strings is called args. The three Strings
//are input (what you type in from the keyboard), output (what is sent to your monitor) and error (a set of error codes sometimes used for debugging.)
//MyClass is the name of the class which is being made into an object
//new tells the computer to make a new something, in this case an object. It is a keyword.

//MyObj is the name of the object.
//DO NOT use these names for any project you do for this class. They are poor names, only useful as examples.
//= Take what is on the right and put it into what is on the left. Assignment.
//MyClass() is a constructor. It does the actual building of the object using the class blueprint.
//; end of a statement in Java. Required!
//myObj.myNumber This means go to the object called myObj and find the variable called myNumber and put it here
//1. fields: A field is a set of variables. These variables are usually declared private. This means only the object can change access or change them.
//2. constructors: code that takes the class and builds objects
//3. methods: code that does something
//a. getter: code that allows the object to get a variable, also called an accessor
//b. setter: code that allows the object to change the variable, also called a mutator
//c. other methods needed to do what the object is supposed to
